# Pig Game

It's a game I built to practice on JavaScript

and it's a game of two players rolling the dice and keeping the value in a placeholder colled 'Current'

untill either you click 'Hold' and the points in the 'Current' become scores

or you get the dice 1 and you lose the points in the 'Current' box

and when the scores become 100 point or more you win.

PLEASE give it a try [here]()
